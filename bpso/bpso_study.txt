# Simple Memory Test

# This is a simple memory test, where people indicate old/new for a stream of intermixed
# target images and foil images

  # This is the table that determines each test phase trial. This table contains:

  # trialnum = the trial number
  # image = the image name
  # oldnew = whether the image is a target (old, 1) or a foil (new, 2)
